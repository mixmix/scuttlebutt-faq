You can help with the FAQ by asking a question, refining one of my answers, or submitting an entire question and answer.

I am using gitbook to assemble this all, and so to help with any of the above simply submit a change request on the gitbook page, found [here](https://www.gitbook.com/book/nelsonian/ssb-faq/edit#/edit/master/README.md?_k=4k2qxt)

If that does not work, you can reach me through scuttlebutt.  My scuttlename is @ZqH7Mctu/7DNInxuwl12ECjfrAKUX2tBLq1rOldNhg0=.ed25519

I love any help you want to give, with one caveat: This FAQ is intended as a sort of "on-ramp" to the scuttleverse, and so meant to be simple.  I would love to have links to deeper and more technical resources, but this should not be seen as a FAQ for the highly technical stuff (so no questions about how to make an SSB app  with just tin cans, a hacked talkboy, and a cursory knowledge of LISP.)
*(Though as I write this I realize that answer would be super cool and so I urge you to start up an advanced FAQ if you're able.)*
