# Who wrote this FAQ?

*And where are they getting their answers?*

This FAQ was originally started by Zach. He was helped by his entire scuttle network.  Much of the responses were taken from replies on scuttlebutt and have been credited as such in the source section of the answers.

The FAQ, ideally, will have many contributors.  One of the contributors could be you, and so it's fair to say this FAQ was probably also written by future you.
