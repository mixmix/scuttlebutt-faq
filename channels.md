Channels are a way to organize your messages and conversations, but offer no additional functionality that's not already part of scuttlebutt.  Subscribing to a channel will let you read messages from your friends (and friends of friends) who have written in this channel, but you will not see any channel messages from folks not in your network.  If a friend posts to a channel you do not subscribe to, you will still see this message as part of your feed ( since it's something your friend wrote and you're interested in what they have to say regardless of how they've organized it).

If scuttlebutt works as a big diary--with each message you post added to the end of your diary and shared with your friends-- then channels are like writing a diary entry with a different colored pen  as a personal form of organization.  And, luckily, your friends follow this same technique and use the same pens and so you can easily share your related messages.

There has been discussion on whether channels should work more like hashtags, and to have a distinct "group" feature that would behave closer to a slack channel or discussion group.  You can read more of that conversation here: %hvzFfncCUGifB+ShGmmdr+ZZuYx/3iyY0wCg5oWhqlY=.sha256
